# Stock-Analysis of Major Technology Stocks

## Instructions

To try running the notebook or seeing the code yourself:

- open analysis.ipynb to take a quick look directly on github

or

- git clone the repository and run the analysis in your local code editor

Disclosure: The Y-finance API is a timeseries dataset, and I specified within my code to grab data from one year ago to now(5/5/2025) so depending on when you clone and run the notebook, your data will differ from the analysis in this ReadME.

## Introduction

### Technologies Used:
- Python(Matplotlib, Numpys, Pandas, Seaborn)
- YFinance - Yahoo Finance for Stock Information

### Summary

The goal of this project is to clean, transform and visualize data on a selection of very large technology firms in which afterwards, I will analyze the visuals and draw important insights. Pandas and Numpys will be used to clean and transform data while Matplotlib and Seaborn will be used to make graphs and heatmaps.

Based off of my current working knowledge of the market, I went into this project predicting that the trend between AMD and Nvidia as well as correlation will be negative due to them being direct competitors in the chip market. I also assume Tesla will be extremely volatile and differ trend-wise from the rest of the stocks. Microsoft, Apple, and Google will follow a similar trend being the 'grandfathered' tech giants of our generation.
