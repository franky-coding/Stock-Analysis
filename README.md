# Stock-Analysis of Major Technology Stocks

## ðŸ“‹ Table of Contents

- [Summary & Hypotheses](#introduction)

## Introduction

### Technologies Used:
- Python(Matplotlib, Numpys, Pandas, Seaborn)
- YFinance - Yahoo Finance for Stock Information

### Summary

The goal of this project is to clean, transform and visualize data on a selection of very large technology firms in which afterwards, I will analyze the visuals and draw important insights. Pandas and Numpys will be used to clean and transform data while Matplotlib and Seaborn will be used to make graphs and heatmaps.

Based off of my current working knowledge of the market, I went into this project predicting that the trend between AMD and Nvidia as well as correlation will be negative due to them being direct competitors in the chip market. I also assume Tesla will be extremely volatile and differ trend-wise from the rest of the stocks. Microsoft, Apple, and Google will follow a similar trend being the 'grandfathered' tech giants of our generation.

### Instructions

In order to look at the code to see how I came about building these visuals and the thought process behind it:

- open analysis.ipynb to take a quick look directly on github

or

- git clone the repository and run the analysis in your local code editor

Disclosure: The Y-finance API is a timeseries dataset, and I specified within my code that I will be analyzing data from now (5/5/2025) to one year ago so depending on when you clone or run the notebook, your data will differ from my analysis in this ReadME.
